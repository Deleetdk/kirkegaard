This is my personal R package. It contains a lot of functions but they don't have any general theme, so would not be easy to bundle up into one thematically named package. Instead they are here.

There are functions for areas including:


* Common operations on data.frames, including merging by rownames, standardizing, adding missing data, residualizing and class conversion.
* Functions for automatic statistical modeling such as best subset and penalized regression.
* Spatial statistics, including new methods for measuring and controlling for autocorrelation.
* Elementary matrix operations such as getting a half and restoring a symmetrical matrix from a half.
* Factor analysis, including new methods for checking for method variance, finding odd cases, using Jensen's method and plotting loadings.
* Convenience functions for plotting with ggplot2.
* Various other functions that I often use.
