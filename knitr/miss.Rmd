# `miss_add_random`: Add random missing data to a data frame

```{r miss_add_random}
(df = data_frame(numbers = 1:10, letters = letters[1:10]))
(df = miss_add_random(df))
```

#`miss_amount`: How much data is missing?
`miss_amount` returns three simple metrics for the amount of missing data: by cell, by case and by variable.

```{r miss_amount}
miss_amount(df)
```

# `miss_filter`: Filter data frame by missing rows
`miss_filter` provides an easy way to filter a data frame by the amount of missing data in the rows.

```{r miss_filter}
miss_filter(df) #default is filter all cases with missing, same as na.omit
```
